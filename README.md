## Bunny Tidy Up: A Platform Game

A simple platform game with a focus on raising awareness on Life on Land (SDG 15) created using Unity and C#.

This project focusing on creating a simple game while implementing the process of software project management, following through with each step of the **Evolutionary Prototyping model**. This included 6 main phases:

1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Prototype
5. Implementation
6. Testing

Moreover, we developed the **use case diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, and cyclomatic complexity score** for the game. The project was also conducted based on the calculations of the effort estimation using **functional point analysis table** calculation.
The project's **risk table** was assessed, and mitigation plans were put in place to ensure smooth execution. 

With the developed prototype, we created 3 possible test cases to determine the passability and executability of our game for first-time users. 

_This project was created as a group project for BINUS University's Software Engineering course. A simple prototype was developed and is not officially launched as a downloadable game. No plagiarism is intended._

A technical report has also been uploaded with details regarding the software project management and background of the game.
Due to the file size limit, the gameplay .exe file cannot be uploaded. However, the game demo can be seen through the following link:
